# OpenStack cluster with chef-provisioning

This is the testing framework for OpenStack and Chef. We leverage this to test against our changes to our [cookbooks](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Chef/GettingStarted) to make sure
that you can still build a cluster from the ground up with any changes we push up.

This framework also gives us an opportunity to show different Reference Architectures and a sane example on how to start with OpenStack and Chef.

With the `master` branch of the cookbooks, which is currently tied to the base OpenStack Liberty release, this supports deploying to Ubuntu 14.04 and CentOS 7.2 for all-in-one with nova-network.  Support for all-in-one with Neutron, and multi-node support, is a work in progress.

## Prereqs

- [ChefDK](https://downloads.chef.io/chef-dk/) 0.9.0 or 0.10.0
- [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) 1.7.2 or later with [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) or some other provider

## Initial Setup Steps

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/openstack/openstack-chef-repo.git
$ cd openstack-chef-repo
$ chef exec rake berks_vendor
```

The OpenStack cookbooks by default use databags for configuring passwords.  There are four
data_bags : *user_passwords*, *db_passwords*, *service_passwords*, *secrets*. I already created
the `data_bags/` directory, so you shouldn't need to make them; if you do something's broken.
See [Databags](#databags) section below for more details.

**NOTE**: If you are running Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and as your **base** compute machine, you should note that the shipped
kernel `3.13.0-24-generic` has networking issues, and the best way to resolve this is
via: `apt-get install linux-image-generic-lts-utopic`. This will install at least `3.16.0` from the Utopic hardware enablement.

## Supported Deployments

* All-in-One
  * Neutron
* Multi-Node
  * Neutron

For each deployment model, there is a corresponding readme file in the doc/ directory.  Please review that for specific details and additional setup that might be required before deploying the cloud.

## Rake Deploy Commands

These commands will spin up various OpenStack cluster configurations, the simplest being the all-in-one controller with nova-network.

For CentOS, set the environment variable REPO_OS=centos7

```bash
# All-in-one controller with neutron-network
$ chef exec rake allinone
# Multi-Node Setup with neutron-network (1 controller + 2 compute nodes)
$ chef exec rake multi_node
 ```

### Access the Controller

```bash
$ cd vms
$ vagrant ssh controller
$ sudo su -
```

### Access the Compute nodes

```bash
$ cd vms
$ vagrant ssh compute1
# OR
$ vagrant ssh compute2
$ sudo su -
```

### Testing the Controller

```bash
# Access the controller as noted above
$ source openrc
$ nova-manage version
$ nova service-list && nova hypervisor-list
$ glance image-list
$ keystone user-list
$ nova list
```

### Working with Security Groups ###

To allow SSH access to instances, a nova security group is defined as follows:

```bash
$ nova secgroup-list
$ nova secgroup-list-rules default
$ nova secgroup-create allow_ssh "allow ssh to instance"
$ nova secgroup-add-rule allow_ssh tcp 22 22 0.0.0.0/0
$ nova secgroup-list-rules allow_ssh
```

### Working with keys ###

To allow SSH keys to be injected into instance, a nova keypair is defined as follows:

```bash
# Just press Enter to all the questions
$ ssh-keygen
$ nova keypair-add --pub-key=/root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub mykey
```

#### Booting up a cirros image on the Controller

```bash
$ nova boot test --image cirros --flavor 1  --security-groups=allow_ssh --key-name=mykey
```

Wait a few seconds and the run `nova list` if Status is not Active, wait a few seconds and repeat.

Once status is active you should be able to log in via ssh to the listed IP.

```bash
$ ssh cirros@<ip address from nova list output>
```

#### Accessing the OpenStack Dashboard

If you would like to use the OpenStack dashboard you should go to https://localhost:9443 and the username and password is `admin/mypass`.

#### Verifying stack with tempest

If you ssh into the `controller` machine you can test via the most recent [tempest](https://github.com/openstack/tempest) release.

```bash
$ cd vms
$ vagrant ssh controller
$ sudo su -
root@controller:~ cd /opt/tempest
root@controller:/opt/tempest$ ./run_tempest.sh -V --smoke --serial

[-- snip --]

tempest.tests.test_wrappers.TestWrappers
    test_pretty_tox                                                       1.68
    test_pretty_tox_fails                                                 1.03
    test_pretty_tox_serial                                                0.61
    test_pretty_tox_serial_fails                                          0.55

Ran 233 tests in 13.869s

OK
Running flake8 ...

```


## Cleanup

To remove all the nodes and start over again with a different environment or different environment attribute overrides, using the following rake command.

```bash
$ chef exec rake destroy_machines
```

To refresh all the cookbooks, use the following rake commands.

```bash
$ chef exec rake destroy_cookbooks
$ chef exec rake berks_vendor
```

To cleanup everything, use the following rake command.

```bash
$ chef exec rake clean
```

## Tools

See the doc/tools.md for more information.

## Databags

Some basic information about the use of databags within this repo.

```
# Show the list of databags
$ chef exec knife  data bag list -z
db_passwords
secrets
service_passwords
user_passwords

# Show the list of data bag items
$ chef exec knife data bag show db_passwords -z
cinder
dash
glance
horizon
keystone
neutron
nova

# Show contents of data bag item
$ chef exec knife data bag show db_passwords nova -z
Encrypted data bag detected, decrypting with provided secret.
nova: mypass
id:   nova

# Update contents of data bag item
# set EDITOR env var to your editor. For PowerShell, I used nano
$ chef exec knife data bag edit secrets dispersion_auth_user -z
```

### Data bag default values
db_passwords are set to "mypass"
secrets are set to "<key>_token"
service_passwords are set to "mypass"
user_passwords are set to "mypass"

### Default encrypted data bag secret
The default secret is stored here .chef/encrypted_data_bag_secret
and referenced by .chef/knife.rb.

## Known Issues and Workarounds

### Windows Platform

When using this on a Windows platform, here are some tweaks to make this work:

- In order to get SSH to work, you will need an SSL client installed.  You can use the one that comes with [Git for Windows](http://git-scm.com/download).  You will need to append `C:\Program Files (x86)\Git\bin;` to the system PATH.

## TODOs

- Support for floating IPs
- Better instructions for multi-node network setup
- Split out the `multi-neutron-network-node` cluster also so the network node is it's own machine
- Easier debugging. Maybe a script to pull the logs from the controller.
